CSS:

The only CSS you need to load on top of Bootstrap’s is “slate-theme.css”

It is compiled from the LESS files.

If you apply changes to some of the LESS files, make sure you re-compile using “slate-theme.less”

JavaScript:

Make sure “js/slate.js” is included on all pages. It is necessary for the navbar’s search field.

All the other useful javascript plugins are located in “js/plugins”.

Some javascript has been written on each page for some demonstration purposes. It can be found before the end of the Body Tag, at the bottom of each page.
